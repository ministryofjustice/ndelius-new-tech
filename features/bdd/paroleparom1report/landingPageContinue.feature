Feature: Parole Report

  Scenario: Delius User wants to continue writing a Parole Report for a Prisoner

    Given that the user is on the Parole Report landing page for an existing report
    When  they select the "Continue now" button
    Then  the user should be directed to the last page that they were on working on

  Scenario Outline: A time stamp must be displayed on the landing page to state when the user last worked on the report

    Given I had previously edited a report "<minutes>" ago
    When when I navigate to the Parole Report landing page for that report
    Then I should the the timestamp "<timestamp>" display indicating when the report was last edited

    Examples:
      | minutes | timestamp |
      | 1       | 1 minute ago |
      | 10      | 10 minutes ago |
      | 60      | 1 hour ago |
      | 1440    | 1 day ago |
      | 144000  | 100 days ago |
