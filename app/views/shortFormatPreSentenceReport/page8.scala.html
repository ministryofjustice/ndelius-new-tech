    <p>Have you considered what equality and diversity issues are present and how they can help inform your proposal?</p>
    <p>Have you used the effective proposal tool?</p>
    <p>Be aware of the sentencing guidelines and relevant legislation. Remember to reference the sentencing intentions of the court, if they were made clear.</p>
    <p>Consider all possible sentencing options, and whether or not the offender is past the custody threshold or suitable for a community order.</p>
    <p>Consider and describe both aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
    <p>Consider whether specific needs such as gender, maturity, diversity make particular sentences more appropriate.</p>
    <p>In cases of women, ensure that you think about women only disposals and that your proposal gives a robust community option.</p>
    <p>Make clear how your proposals will manage risk.</p>
    <p>What will the impact of the sentence be on the offender?</p>
    <p>How will the proposed sentence affect the offenderâ€™s family and anyone for whom they have caring responsibilities?</p>
    <p>Remember that evidence shows that imprisonment of mothers has significant impacts on those that they care for.</p>
    <p>If relevant, what is not suitable in this case?</p>
    <p>Are there any relevant alternative requirements that the offender may have been eligible for, but circumstances have made them unsuitable for participation?</p>
    <p>Remember that your proposal should be commensurate with risk and need. Proposals should not be made for suspended sentence orders.</p>
