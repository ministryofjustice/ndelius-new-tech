        <li>The nature of the risk to all victims who remain at risk now and in the future.</li>
        <li>Consideration of the risk to victims from the index offence and from relevant previous offences.</li>
        <li>Risks to the prisoner through self-harm or from others.</li>
        <li>Consideration of cases when there has been a large volume of complaints from victims which, for possibly complex reasons, have not resulted in prosecution. Liaise with police to obtain and analyse reports to determine whether they contain relevant evidence to put before the Parole Board.</li>
        <li>Do not comment on whether you believe any allegations or unconvicted behaviours are true or false. You should assess any impact the behaviours could have on the assessment if they were true or false. If you are unsure or are concerned that comments could lead to legal challenges, speak to PPCS.</li>
        <li>Analysis and a clear indication of the nature of the risk, for example, physical, emotional, psychological or financial. Avoid generalisations such as ‘violence’ - be specific, for example, ‘use of physical violence including strangulation’ or ‘emotional abuse in the form of controlling behaviours’.</li>
        <li>A distinction between direct harm (for example, physical abuse or neglect) or indirect harm (for example, emotional harm due to witnessing domestic abuse), if risks to children have been identified.</li>

        <li>Identification of triggers, factors, situations, people, places and other potential circumstances that might increase the risk, now and in the future. Record if they are currently present or absent.</li>
        <li>A distinction between evidence gathered from convictions and evidence from allegations or complaints (not resulted in convictions). In certain cases it might be useful to produce 2 risk assessments - one clearly marked as information from additional untried evidence and one with evidence from convicted offences.</li>
        <li>Do not comment on whether you believe any allegations or unconvicted behaviours are true or false. You should assess any impact the behaviours could have on the assessment if they were true or false. If you are unsure or are concerned that comments could lead to legal challenges, speak to PPCS.</li>
        <li>A link between the original (this could include PSR or MALRAP) and the current risk assessments - include what has changed. Use the OASys assessment and other relevant assessments.</li>
        <li>Information from prison staff, gender identity clinics or previous and current agencies. For example, a mental health professional can advise you about a prisoner’s behaviour if they stop taking medication.</li>
        <li>Information from previous probation records might be useful, for example, how a prisoner coped with a difficult situation.</li>
        <li>Information from ViSOR and MAPPA meetings might be useful.</li>
        <li>Consideration for women who may have been victimised or experienced physical or sexual abuse - how the risk might increase on their release.</li>
        <li>Consideration of how non-compliance can link to increases in risk.</li>
        <li>Diversity considerations.</li>
        <li>Information from PD case formulations - specialists develop hypotheses about development, activation and maintenance of problems.</li>
        <li>Factors linked to risk from previous Parole Board direction letters.</li>
        <li>Consideration for previous offences and paralleling behaviours linked to risk.</li>
        <li>A full analysis - not bulleted points without description. The factors you have identified in this section will need to be addressed in the ‘Contingency plan’ section of the RMP for all on and post-tariff prisoners.</li>

        <li>Identification of restrictive measures and specific interventions such as approved premises, civil orders and additional licence conditions.</li>
        <li>Factors that have prevented the prisoner from causing harm, for example, engagement with statutory and non-statutory agencies or the identification of specific work.</li>
