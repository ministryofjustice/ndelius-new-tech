    <p>Authors should remain mindful that whilst the Parole Board will consider their recommendations, the panel members will make their own independent assessment and decision. Ensuring that you set out clearly and succinctly the reasons behind your recommendation will help to strengthen your argument and this should flow logically from the information in the main body of the report.</p>
    <p class="govuk-!-margin-top-2">The recommendation should take into account all previous offending behaviours, the level of risk the prisoner would present if released under the proposed risk management plan, how realistic management in the community will be both in terms of risk and likely compliance and be informed by all relevant equality and diversity considerations. This does not mean you need to write this out but that you have considered it in making your recommendation.</p>
    <p class="govuk-!-margin-top-2">Information and assessments provided by Specialists (including those commissioned by the prisoner’s legal team) and prison staff should be considered. It is helpful to reflect and comment upon any differences in the recommendations they have provided.</p>
    <p class="govuk-!-margin-top-2">Please refer to the Parole Board powers document (Appendix 1). The Parole Board cannot direct a move to open conditions for all cases.</p>
    <p class="govuk-!-margin-top-2">Where possible one HMPPS recommendation should be agreed. In cases where the prison and community offender managers have alternative views, these should be fully explored and as far as possible resolved prior to the report being written. However, where any issues remain, the author should make it clear that they have been made aware of the prison offender manager’s recommendation and assessment of risk. The reasons for any differences in assessment should be explained and the authors recommendation made clear.</p>
    <p class="govuk-!-margin-top-2">It is of note that MAPPA cannot make recommendations.</p>
    <p class="govuk-!-margin-top-2">Where release is not supported, the reasons for this should be clearly outlined and evidenced and flow logically from the detail contained in the body of the report. The next steps the prisoner is required to take should be provided in detail, and the author should clarify when they will be available, and these should be discussed with the prisoner.</p>
    <p class="govuk-!-margin-top-2">Where outstanding reports are required before a full decision can be made, this should be clearly outlined along with the timeframe, so that should the parole board require an addendum report, this can be made available prior to the oral hearing e.g. an outstanding psychology or post programme report.</p>
